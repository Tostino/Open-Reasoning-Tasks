# Describing Spatial Relationships

## Description:
This task involves accurately describing the relative positions and orientations of objects in space. It evaluates the model's ability to understand and communicate spatial concepts clearly.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Describe the spatial relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon.
```

Output:

```
The Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical path, completing one revolution approximately every 365.25 days. This orbit has an average radius of about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), defining the Astronomical Unit (AU).

The Moon, meanwhile, orbits around the Earth at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles). This orbit takes approximately 27.3 days to complete. As the Moon circles the Earth, it also travels with our planet around the Sun.

From Earth's perspective, the Sun and Moon appear roughly the same size in the sky, despite vast differences in their actual sizes and distances. This is a cosmic coincidence: the Sun's diameter is about 400 times larger than the Moon's, but it's also about 400 times farther away from Earth.

The Moon's position relative to the Earth and Sun causes its visible phases. As it orbits, different portions of its sunlit surface are visible from Earth, creating the familiar cycle from new moon to full moon and back.

This three-body system also explains various celestial events. For example, solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and Sun, while lunar eclipses happen when the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon.

### Example 2:

Input:

```
Describe the spatial arrangement of keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard.
```

Output:

```
A standard QWERTY keyboard typically features six or seven horizontal rows of keys, arranged in a staggered pattern from top to bottom:

1. **Function Keys Row** (top row): 
   - F1 through F12, arranged from left to right (F1 on far left, F12 on far right)
   - Often includes system keys like Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause/Break to the right of F12

2. **Number Row** (second from top): 
   - Begins with ` (backtick) on the far left
   - Digits 1234567890, arranged from left to right
   - Followed by - (hyphen) and = (equals) to the right of the digits
   - Backspace key occupies a larger space on the right of the equals

3. **Top Letter Row**:
   - QWERTYUIOP from left to right
   - Tab key (larger than letter keys) on the far left
   - Additional symbols to the right of P: [ ] \ (may vary slightly by region)

4. **Home Row** (middle row of letters):
   - ASDFGHJKL from left to right
   - Caps Lock key (often larger) on the far left
   - Additional symbols to the right of L: ; ' (semicolon and apostrophe)
   - Enter/Return key on the far right (often larger, L-shaped, extending down to the row below)

5. **Bottom Letter Row**:
   - ZXCVBNM from left to right
   - Shift keys on both ends (larger than letter keys)
   - Additional symbols to the right of M: , . / (comma, period, forward slash)

6. **Modifier Key Row** (bottom row):
   - Ctrl, Win/CMD, Alt keys on both sides of the spacebar
   - Spacebar (longest key, centered in the middle of the keyboard)
   - Sometimes includes a Function (Fn) key on laptops, typically on the left side

7. **Additional Keys** (may be arranged differently or absent on some keyboards):
   - Arrow keys (often in an inverted T shape, typically located between the main keyboard area and the numpad)
   - Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, Page Down (usually in two rows of three above the arrow keys)
   - Num Lock and Numeric Keypad (on full-size keyboards, positioned on the far right)

The keys are typically arranged in a slightly staggered pattern from row to row, rather than in perfectly straight columns. This means each row is slightly offset from the ones above and below it. For example, the 'A' key is not directly below the 'Q' key, but slightly to the right of it.
